    <h2 class="text-center">OUR STORY</h2>

    <p>It was another day on the Negombo beach in the early 1970s; he was Herbert Cooray – a visionary, a pioneer of tourism in Sri Lanka and the founding father of Jetwing. The homely villa he built and named Blue Oceanic of just six rooms may have been small, but the heartfelt warmth it offered was immense. It all began with a humble desire to share the experience of true hospitality of a Sri Lankan family with others. A simple dream which grew to an ever furthering vision that made us – the company he founded, what we are today – one of the largest, most respected, and recognized tourism organisations in Sri Lanka, and a family of hotels like no other.</p>
